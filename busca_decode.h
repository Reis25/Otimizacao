/**
 * LevitacaoDecoder.h
 *
 * The chromosome's fitness is computed as the sum of its individual alleles. We also show how to
 * generate a random permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} using the supplied chromosome.
 *
 * Any Decoder class must implement either of the methods:
 *     1. double decode(std::vector< double >&)
 *     2. double decode(std::vector< double >&) const
 *     3. double decode(const std::vector< double >&)
 *     4. double decode(const std::vector< double >&) const
 * where the returned double corresponds to the fitness of that chromosome. If parallel decoding
 * is to be used in the BRKGA framework, then decode() *must* be thread-safe; the best way to
 * guarantee this is by via member const-correctness -- see (2) and (4) above --  so that the
 * property will be checked at compile time. An exception to this rule is the use of the mutant
 * modifier in data members of the decoder, which bypasses const-correctness and may introduce
 * dangerous race conditions in a multithreaded environment.
 *
 * The chromosome inside the BRKGA framework can be changed if desired. To do so, just use the
 * signatures (1) and (3) above which do not forbid the chromosome to be changed (and such change
 * gets reflected in BRKGA). Please use double values in the interval [0,1) when updating, thus
 * obeying the BRKGA guidelines -- for speed, BRKGA does *not* enforce this.
